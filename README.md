# Arduino-Boilerplate
***A project by Sam Daitzman***

This is in development and has known issues. Don't use it yet if you want something stable!

Arduino-boilerplate is a template for your next Arduino-based project. It works with the Arduino app, [Stino](https://github.com/Robot-Will/Stino), or your favorite text editor. Just follow these instructions to get started:

1. Fork or download this repository. You can click "Download ZIP" if you're on github
2. Open `program/program.ino`. If you're using Arduino, `imports.ino` and `variables.ino` should open automatically. Add your name to the third line down, where it says `// This program was created by <HUMAN>`
3. Uncomment any libraries you need in `imports.ino`. Add any others that you want to the same file
4. Don't forget to change this file (`README.md`) to match your project!
